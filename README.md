# hello-world1
didn't complete last hello world initialization. Needed to git (get it?, "git") going again!!!

on third step of the journey, it's hard to type without looking at the keyboard;;;
Imagine, 7 years in and out of this business and cannot write without looking at the keyboard!!!
Listening to witcher 3 another round for everyone, nice music to clap to I think.
